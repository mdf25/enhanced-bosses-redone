# Enhanced Bosses Redone
Adds new attacks and abilities to the bosses of Valheim.

Due to limited knowledge of server modding for Valheim I am no longer maintaining this mod. 
If you are a mod developer and wish to take this mod under your wing for future versions of Valheim - I provide you everything I've worked on. :D

Everything works fine on SP for the most part, but in MP there are some strange bugs and I'm unsure how to fix these.

Known bugs:
- The green effect from Bonemass' hallucinations stay active (SP and MP)
- If players die when boss abilities are active such as Yagluth's rock formation, the game can freeze requiring a relog. (MP)
- Eikthyr's storm clouds don't always render out - but do fix themselves eventually. (SP and MP)
- Bonemass' ancient oozers move weirdly. (MP)
- Moder does not attack whilst in Ancient form. (MP)
